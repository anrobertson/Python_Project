# Python_Project

## Overview of Analysis
Created mock data of "Unknown" transfers of unassigned accounts to show the potential of what Python can accomplish.

## Technology used
* Python
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
* [Mock data created for this project](https://github.com/anrobertson/Python_Project/blob/main/mock_data.csv)

## The process
### What are the challenges I would like to solve?
Before starting to create the mock data for this project, I wanted to think of a good example of when utilizing Python could help us answer questions we may have about the business and even open up more conversations of ways to improve in different areas.

## Summary
For the purpose of this analysis, I wanted to show
